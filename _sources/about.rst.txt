About pwntools
========================

Whether you're using it to write exploits, or as part
of another software project will dictate how you use it.

Historically pwntools was used as a sort of exploit-writing DSL. Simply doing
``from pwn import *`` in a previous version of pwntools would bring all sorts of
nice side-effects.
